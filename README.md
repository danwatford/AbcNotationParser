# ABC Notation Parser
Parser and processor for tunes written in ABC Notation. Based on information from http://abcnotation.com/learn

This library contains a parser and serializer for ABC Notation. It also contains some basic processing to remove
comments, line continuations and to extract note sequences. The original intent of the library was to provide
a way to extract notes from ABC tunes in order to find matching note sequences across tunes.
